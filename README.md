    <h1>Roblox Client Optimizer Mac</h1>
    <p>Unofficial mac port of Roblox Client Optimizer for macOS</p>
</div>

## Disclaimer

You should only use this for the time being as I'm sure Roblox Client Optimizer will be expanded to support macOS

## About

This is a simple tool that fetches the ClientAppSettings.json hosted on the official ROC url and automatically places it in its respective directory for your convienience

## Credits

I borrowed the header from the ROC readme file

## TODO

Rewrite this in rust
